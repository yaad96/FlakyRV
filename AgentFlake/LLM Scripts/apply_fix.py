apply_fix.py

Apply an llm_response.json fix to the Flaky/ source tree of a result container.

Pipeline (stops at first success):
    1. git apply -p1                  (strict)
    2. git apply -p1 --recount        (tolerates wrong @@ counts)
    3. Splice output_b.fixed_code via tree-sitter-java  (AST/CST locator)
    4. Splice output_b.fixed_code via regex + masked brace scan  (fallback)

Layers 3 and 4 consume the SAME output_b.fixed_code (operation/anchor schema).
Layer 3 uses a real Java parser to locate the method / class body, so it is
immune to braces inside string-literals or comments, to call-sites that share
a method's name, and to generics / lambdas / nested classes. It is REQUIRED:
`tree-sitter` + `tree-sitter-java` must be importable (see requirements.txt;
needs a py-tree-sitter supporting Parser(Language(capsule)), >=0.22). If they
are missing the layer raises ImportError with install instructions rather than
silently falling through — silent absence would produce inconsistent apply
reports across machines and hide environmental drift in a research pipeline.
Layer 3 is transactional (snapshots all target files and rolls back every
partial write if any entry fails, so Layer 4 starts from a clean tree) and
defers genuinely ambiguous cases to Layer 4 (e.g. an `end_of_class` insert in
a file with more than one top-level type). Layer 4 — the regex splicer whose
brace scan is string/comment masked — is the fallback for those deferrals.

After a successful apply:
    - host-side `javac` smoke-tests each touched .java file (syntax check)
    - container-side `mvn test-compile` regenerates bytecode in target/
      so downstream surefire runs don't read stale .class files
The applier modifies Flaky/ in-place and writes a JSON report to
Steps_Output_Files/apply_report.json.

Usage:
    python apply_fix.py <result_container> [--no-verify] [--no-recompile]
                                           [--docker-container NAME] [--dry-run]

The Flaky/ directory does NOT need to be a git repository — git apply
operates on plain unified diffs without an index when invoked with --check
or against a working tree.

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Path resolution (shared by layer 1/2 patch applier AND layer 3 splicer)
#
# Why this exists: LLMs sometimes produce patches with paths that omit a
# Maven module prefix (e.g., `src/test/java/...` instead of
# `<module>/src/test/java/...`). Without correction, `git apply` either
# creates an orphan file at the wrong path (silent failure) or the splicer
# reports `file not found`. Either way, the verdict ends up FAILED with a
# misleading-or-empty trail.
#
# Strategy: SUFFIX match, not basename match. We only resolve a missing
# path to an existing one when the existing path *ends with* the original.
# This rules out the dangerous test/main cross-over case
# (LLM said `src/test/.../Foo.java`; ONLY existing `Foo.java` is at
# `src/main/.../Foo.java` — different suffix, no rewrite, original passes
# through and git apply fails honestly).

# are typically build artifacts or VCS internals that may contain copies
# of source files; matching them would be actively wrong.

      (b) every target file's content actually changed on disk,
      (c) every newly-CREATED file is structurally valid Java.

    Three guards against silent-failure modes seen in practice:

    1. Path fuzzy-match (idea 1) — before any git apply, we resolve each
       target path against the actual file tree using suffix matching.
       This catches LLM patches that omit a Maven module prefix (e.g.,
       `src/test/java/...` instead of `<module>/src/test/java/...`).

    2. Hash-based silent-skip detection (idea 3a) — `git apply` outside a
       git repo will print 'Skipped patch <path>.' and return exit 0 when
       it can't find the context cleanly (often due to bad line numbers).
       We compare before/after hashes to catch this.

    3. Malformed-create check (idea 3b) — when the LLM emits a method body
       without its enclosing class wrapper plus a `@@ -0,0 +1,N @@` (file-
       create) header, `git apply` happily creates an orphan file with no
       package/class declaration. We validate any newly-created `.java`
       file has `package X.Y.Z;` AND a top-level type declaration; if not,
       we roll back and fall through to the next layer.

    Failure modes that survive these checks should genuinely be patch

         insert_method with @@ANCHOR). Collected into `result_src`
         (single return point so the post-step can run uniformly).
      3. Auto-import inference: scan the inserted code for @Annotation
         references that the file doesn't already import; add any that
         match the well-known table (idea 2).

    pre-build does, ensuring multi-phase build artifacts are available.

    Why `install -DskipTests`, not the narrower `test-compile`:
    Java projects with `package`-phase plugins (maven-shade-plugin to
    produce relocated/shaded jars, antrun, exec-maven-plugin generated
    sources, etc.) require those plugins to run BEFORE test sources can
    compile, because some test files reference the plugins' output.
    `mvn test-compile` only runs through the `test-compile` phase — it
    never reaches `package`, so the shaded jars don't exist on the
    classpath, and the test compile fails with cryptic "package X does
    not exist" errors on completely unrelated test files.

    Concrete example seen on BOOKKEEPER-846: `TestBackwardCompat.java`
    references `org.apache.bk_v4_2_0.bookkeeper.client` — a shaded
    backward-compat jar built by maven-shade-plugin during `package`.
    With `mvn test-compile` the shaded jar is missing, so test-compile
    of bookkeeper-server fails — even though the LLM's patch only
    touched a `@Test(timeout=...)` value on a different file.

    `mvn install -DskipTests` runs through the `install` lifecycle phase
    (which includes `package`), giving every plugin a chance to produce
    its outputs before test sources are compiled. `-DskipTests` skips
    only test EXECUTION — `test-compile` still runs as part of the
    lifecycle. Same recipe step 6c uses, same observed compile success.

    Cost: ~30-60s slower per recompile on large projects (BookKeeper).
    Acceptable trade-off for not silently false-failing on multi-phase
    projects.
