build_feedback.py — produce the feedback_payload.txt user-turn body.

Called by the orchestrator after step 11 detects a retriable failure
(compile_failed, test_failed, or patch_apply_failed). Reads
apply_report.json and (for test_failed only) verify_after_fix.log to
construct a category-specific feedback payload that's then handed to
call_llm_*.py --feedback-from as the next user turn in the conversation.

Usage:
    python3 build_feedback.py <result_container> <fail_category>

where fail_category is one of:
  - compile_failed      (patch landed, mvn test-compile failed)
  - test_failed         (patch landed and compiled, surefire still failed)
  - patch_apply_failed  (no layer of the applier could land the patch)

# mention generic Java syntax errors (variables outside methods/classes,

PATCH_APPLY_TEMPLATE = """=== ROUND 2: YOUR PATCH FAILED TO APPLY ===

Your previous response was processed but NO layer of the applier could
land the patch on disk. The Flaky/ source tree is unchanged from its
pre-attempt state.

Per-layer rejection (in attempt order):

{layers}

{path_rewrites}Final result: {final_reason}

What this usually means (in order of frequency seen in practice):
  1. The `file` path references a file that does NOT exist in the
     source tree — often a missing Maven module prefix, or the path
     was hallucinated. The applier tries a unique-suffix match against
     the real tree before giving up; if that also fails, the file
     genuinely doesn't exist where you claimed.
  2. (replace_method) The named method does not exist in the target
     file — typo, wrong file, or the method is on an inner class
     that a different `file` field would target.
  3. (insert_method) Either the named method already exists in the
     target file (operation contradicts state — should be replace_method
     instead), or the `anchor` target method does not exist.
  4. (unified diff) The @@ context lines do not match the real file
     content — line numbers or surrounding code were guessed, and
     git apply rejects on context mismatch (or applies silently to
     no effect, which the applier detects via hash and rolls back).
  5. (rare) The patch CREATES a new .java file whose contents are
     just a method/statement fragment with no `package X.Y.Z;`
     declaration and no top-level class declaration. The applier
     rolls these back as malformed Java.

Note: Flaky/ has been restored to its pre-attempt state — no partial
edits remain. Reply with the SAME schema (OUTPUT 0 / A / B). Make
sure every `file` path references an existing file in the tree,
every `replace_method` names a method that actually exists in that
file, and every unified-diff @@ context line matches the real file
content verbatim.

If you are uncertain whether a file path, class, or method exists in
the tree, reply with an <ARTIFACTS_REQUESTED> block instead — the next
turn will return the requested artifacts and you can then emit a
corrected fix using the verified information.

    `failed[]` list (per-entry breakdown) is rendered as nested bullets
    when present — that's where the most actionable diagnostic lives
    (which exact entry's file/method/anchor was unfindable).

    path_rewrites_block: a labelled section listing every original→resolved
    path mapping the applier performed. Two sources are merged:
      - `layer.path_rewritten` (apply_patch's unified-diff header rewrites)

        rewrites, only present on entries that landed — apply_fix.py
        doesn't preserve the original path on failed-after-resolve entries)
    Empty string when neither source contributed — keeps the template's
    slot vacant so the rendered payload doesn't emit a stray blank section.

    `git apply --check` stderr (with embedded hunk-context excerpts)
