assemble_llm_context_id.py

ID-specific variant of assemble_llm_context.py. Produces a structured LLM
context file for ID (Implementation-Dependent) flaky tests.

Differences from the OD/TD assembler:
  - No POLLUTER section (ID has no polluter — the failure is caused by JDK
    iteration order shuffled by NonDex on a given seed, not by a preceding
    test).
  - VICTIM TEST SOURCE shows the failing test method (or full class).
  - FAILURE OUTPUT comes from traces-fail/mvn.log (the NonDex-with-failing-
    seed run) rather than traces-flaky/.
  - TASK section nudges toward ID-specific fix patterns (LinkedHashSet/Map,
    sort before iterating, containsExactlyInAnyOrder, TreeMap/TreeSet, etc.).
  - The TWO-TURN PROTOCOL + OUTPUT spec + cross-check items are duplicated
    inline so this file is self-contained; we deliberately do NOT modify
    assemble_llm_context.py (OD/TD baseline must keep working unchanged).

Usage:
    python assemble_llm_context_id.py <result_container>

Output:
    data/<result_container>/Steps Output Files/llm_context.txt
