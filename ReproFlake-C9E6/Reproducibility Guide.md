# Reproducibility Guide

This guide reproduces the SWE 699 project pipeline. There are two
reproduction modes documented below: **replay mode** (Section 2, no API
key) and **live mode** (Section 3, requires Claude and OpenAI API keys).
Container `jnrposixd9f3f84` is used as the worked example throughout;
the same procedure applies to every entry in
[test_config.csv](test_config.csv).

This guide also contains a 1-2 sentence description of each artifact
(script files) we authored as part of this project (Section 7), plus a
complete log of one live-mode run of `jnrposixd9f3f84` (Section 8).

---

## 0. TL;DR — Replay mode quick-start

This section collapses Sections 1–5 into a single command sequence for
**replay mode** (no API keys required). For full details on any step, see
the referenced section.

### 0.1 Clone and orient

```bash
git clone https://anonymous.4open.science/r/CS691Project
cd CS691Project/ReproFlake-C9E6
```

### 0.2 Populate the data archives

Download the OneDrive bundle and place the per-container folders under
`data/FULL_RUNS_RV/` and `data/FULL_RUNS_NO_RV/` as described in
Section 1.3.

### 0.3 Create and activate the virtual environment

Replay mode needs no third-party packages — skip `pip install`.

**macOS:**

```bash
# Standard approach
python3 -m venv ~/.venvs/reproflake
source ~/.venvs/reproflake/bin/activate
```

If the above fails with
`ensurepip returned non-zero exit status 1`
(seen with Homebrew Python 3.14 and some Anaconda builds on macOS),
use `--without-pip` instead:

```bash
python3 -m venv --without-pip ~/.venvs/reproflake
source ~/.venvs/reproflake/bin/activate
```

**Ubuntu / Debian:**

```bash
sudo apt-get install -y python3 python3-venv
python3 -m venv ~/.venvs/reproflake
source ~/.venvs/reproflake/bin/activate
```

### 0.4 Run the replay

```bash
./TraceMop\ Scripts/simulate_run_pass_at_k.py jnrposixd9f3f84 \
    --rv-traces yes \
    --models claude,openai \
    --runs 2
```
Warning: in replay mode, if runs > 2, then it is automatically capped to 2 so only 2 runs per container-model combo is generated. 

### 0.5 Check the results

```bash
cat "data/SIMULATED_RUNS_RV/jnrposixd9f3f84 runs/Claude/run 1/Steps Output Files/verify_after_fix.verdict"
head -5 "data/SIMULATED_RUNS_RV/jnrposixd9f3f84 runs/summary.csv"
```

## 1. Repository and data layout

### 1.1 What gets cloned

Cloning the public repo produces a directory with three top-level entries
that the reproducibility pipeline relies on:

```
<cloned-dir>/                            # GitHub clone target — name varies by URL
├── experiments/
│   └── tracemop.jar                     # ~19 MB; copied into the docker container at step 3
├── scripts/
│   ├── javamop-extension/               # Maven Surefire extension; built inside the container at step 4a
│   └── events_encoding_id.txt           # event-ID dictionary used by the trace summarizer
└── ReproFlake-C9E6/                     # the rest of the artifact — you cd here to run anything
    ├── {Simulated} Complete Containers Summary.csv # the summary for all the simulated runs, essentially our oracle for data in the report
    ├── Reproducibility Guide.md         # this file
    ├── test_config.csv                  # one row per supported container; consumed by the orchestrator
    ├── Dockerfile, Dockerfile.id,       # base images (JDK 8 / 11 / 17 variants)
    │   Dockerfile.od, …
    ├── LLM Scripts/                     # Python: prompt assembly, LLM dispatcher + backends, response parser
    ├── TraceMop Scripts/                # bash + Python: per-test-type orchestrators + pass@k wrappers
    └── data/                            # all per-container runtime state (input + output + archives)
```

After `cd <cloned-dir>/ReproFlake-C9E6` every command in this guide is run
from there.

Since Valg and ReproFlake are authored by other people, the new scripts we
introduced as part of this artifact live under `ReproFlake-C9E6/LLM Scripts/`
and `ReproFlake-C9E6/TraceMop Scripts/`. Section 7 (Script reference) only
covers those new files.

### 1.2 Where data lives

All runtime state lives under `ReproFlake-C9E6/data/`. There are four
distinct kinds of subdirectory:

```
ReproFlake-C9E6/data/
├── <container>.zip                      # INPUT  — dataset, downloaded on first use from Zenodo
├── <container>/                         # SCRATCH — workspace; wiped between runs (unless --keep-workspace)
├── FULL_RUNS_RV/                       # ARCHIVE — pre-recorded LLM responses from the live runs (RV ablation)
│   └── <container> runs/
│       ├── summary.csv
        ├── summary.md
│       ├── Claude/run 1/Steps Output Files/llm_response_turn1.json …
│       └── OpenAI/run 1/Steps Output Files/llm_response_turn1.json …
├── FULL_RUNS_NO_RV/                    # ARCHIVE — same shape, no-RV ablation
└── SIMULATED_RUNS_RV/, SIMULATED_RUNS_NO_RV/        # OUTPUT  — populated by replay mode; same layout as FULL_RUNS_*
```

The two `FULL_RUNS_*` archives are the source of truth for replay mode and
must be present before Section 2 will work. They are NOT in the git repo
because they total ~2.5 GB; see Section 1.3.

### 1.3 Populating the archives

The archive bundle is hosted on OneDrive:
[OneDrive: flakyrvlogs](https://gmuedu-my.sharepoint.com/personal/mpious_gmu_edu/_layouts/15/onedrive.aspx?id=%2Fpersonal%2Fmpious%5Fgmu%5Fedu%2FDocuments%2Fflakyrvlogs&ga=1).

The folder names inside the bundle may not match the destination paths in
Section 1.2 exactly (for example, the no-RV folder may be named
`FULL_RUNS_NO_RV`, `FULL_RUNS_RV`, or similar). After unzipping:

- Move every per-container folder from the **RV-labelled** source folder
  into `data/FULL_RUNS_RV/` so it ends up at
  `data/FULL_RUNS_RV/<container> runs/...`.
- Move every per-container folder from the **NO-RV-labelled** source folder
  into `data/FULL_RUNS_NO_RV/` so it ends up at
  `data/FULL_RUNS_NO_RV/<container> runs/...`.

The two destination paths must match Section 1.2 character-for-character
— the orchestrator looks them up by exact name.
Live mode (Section 3) does not need this step.

### 1.4 Why this layout

- **`experiments/` and `scripts/` sit one level above `ReproFlake-C9E6/`**
  because the per-container orchestrator reads `../experiments/tracemop.jar`
  and `../scripts/javamop-extension/` directly. They are shared with the
  parent Valg project and must remain at this relative path.
- **`LLM Scripts/` and `TraceMop Scripts/` are split** so that Python
  prompt-assembly, LLM dispatch, and response parsing stay independently
  testable from the bash orchestrators that drive the docker container.
- **`data/` holds all runtime state** — input zips, scratch workspaces,
  and archived outputs together — so the source tree stays clean and
  `data/` can be excluded wholesale from version control.
- **`FULL_RUNS_RV/` and `FULL_RUNS_NO_RV/`** are kept as separate
  sibling trees so the two ablation configurations described in the report
  cannot collide. `SIMULATED_RUNS_*/` mirrors that split for replay-mode
  output.

---

## 2. Reproduce — Replay mode (no API key)

Replay mode re-runs the SWE 699 pipeline end-to-end using the archived LLM
responses populated in Section 1.3. Every step is real except the LLM API
call, which is replayed from the canned response. No `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`
or `OPENAI_API_KEY` is needed.

### 2.1 Command

```bash
cd <this-cloned-dir>/ReproFlake-C9E6

./TraceMop\ Scripts/simulate_run_pass_at_k.py jnrposixd9f3f84 \
    --rv-traces yes \
    --models claude,openai \
    --runs 2

# Inspect a verdict and the aggregate
cat "data/SIMULATED_RUNS_RV/jnrposixd9f3f84 runs/Claude/run 1/Steps Output Files/verify_after_fix.verdict"
head -5 "data/SIMULATED_RUNS_RV/jnrposixd9f3f84 runs/summary.csv"
```

To replay a different supported container, substitute its `result_container`
value from `test_config.csv`.

### 2.2 Argument reference

| flag | meaning |
|---|---|
| *<result_container>* | the `result_container` value from `test_config.csv` |
| `--rv-traces yes\|no` | required. `yes` replays from `data/FULL_RUNS_RV/` and writes to `data/SIMULATED_RUNS_RV/`. `no` uses the no-RV ablation pair. |
| `--models claude,openai` | comma-separated; default `claude,openai`. Pass either alone to skip the other. |
| `--runs N` | runs per model. Capped at 2 (the archive holds 2 per model); >2 is clamped with a warning. Default 2. |
| `--keep-workspace` | don't clean up `data/<container>/` scratch + docker container after the batch. Default: clean up. |

Before any docker work, the wrapper validates that every `(model, run)`
archive has at least `llm_response_turn1.json`; missing files abort fast.

### 2.3 What's simulated, what's real

Everything runs against the host's docker, JVM, and Maven for real
**except** the LLM call:

- **Real:** zip extract, `Fixed/`/`Flaky/` materialization, container start,
  `tracemop.jar` install, RV trace generation on Fixed + Flaky, trace
  comparison, prompt assembly, patch apply, recompile, post-fix verify,
  feedback-loop branching.
- **Replayed verbatim from archive:** the LLM response text, token usage,
  stop reason, and model name. Carried from
  `Steps Output Files/llm_response_turn{1,2,3,4}.json`.
- **Regenerated from current disk:** `llm_artifacts_turn{2,4}.txt` —
  the artifacts the LLM requested in the canned response are fetched
  fresh from THIS run's source tree.

If simulated verify ever produces a different verdict than the original
(e.g. inherent flakiness in a SUT), the simulator hard-errors with a
"simulation diverged" message and the wrapper records that run as
INCOMPLETE. Remaining `(model, run)` combinations still execute.

---

## 3. Reproduce — Live mode (requires API keys)

Live mode runs the full pipeline against the actual Claude and OpenAI APIs.
This is the path that originally produced the archives in
`data/FULL_RUNS_RV/` and `data/FULL_RUNS_NO_RV/`.

### 3.1 Command

```bash
cd <cloned-dir>/ReproFlake-C9E6
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...

./TraceMop\ Scripts/run_pass_at_k.py jnrposixd9f3f84 \
    --rv-traces yes \
    --models claude,openai \
    --runs 3

cat "data/FULL_RUNS_RV/jnrposixd9f3f84 runs/Claude/run 1/Steps Output Files/verify_after_fix.verdict"
head -5 "data/FULL_RUNS_RV/jnrposixd9f3f84 runs/summary.csv"
```

The default `--models claude,openai` requires both API keys. Pass
`--models claude` or `--models openai` alone to skip the other backend.

### 3.2 Argument reference

| flag | meaning |
|---|---|
| *(positional)* | the `result_container` value from `test_config.csv` |
| `--rv-traces yes\|no` | required. `yes` runs the full pipeline including the RV trace section in the LLM prompt and archives under `data/FULL_RUNS_RV/`. `no` runs the ablation that omits the RV section and archives under `data/FULL_RUNS_NO_RV/`. |
| `--models claude,openai` | comma-separated; default `claude,openai`. |
| `--runs N` | runs per backend. Default 3. |
| `--keep-workspace` | don't clean up `data/<container>/` scratch + docker container after the batch. Default: clean up. |

Each invocation clears and re-runs the requested `(model, run)` folders
before archiving fresh results — re-running the same command intentionally
overwrites those per-run archives.

### 3.3 Backends and first-run timing

Two LLM backends are supported:

- `claude` — Anthropic `claude-sonnet-4-6` ([call_llm_claude.py:38](LLM%20Scripts/call_llm_claude.py#L38)). Requires `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`.
- `openai` — OpenAI `gpt-4o` ([call_llm_openai.py:37](LLM%20Scripts/call_llm_openai.py#L37)). Requires `OPENAI_API_KEY`.

The first invocation for any given `(test_type, java)` pair triggers a
one-time Docker image build that clones and compiles the Surefire fork
inside the container; this typically takes **5–10 minutes**. Subsequent
invocations reuse the cached image and start within seconds. The Zenodo
dataset archive is also downloaded on first use and cached in `data/`.

A complete `--models claude,openai --runs 3` invocation for `jnrposixd9f3f84`
takes approximately **20–40 minutes** end-to-end after one-time setup.

Per-run token counts and wall-clock time are recorded in `summary.csv` and
its human-readable companion `summary.md`, plus the top-level
`Complete Containers Summary.csv`.

---

## 4. Prerequisites

The full list below is what **live mode** (Section 3) needs. **Replay mode**
(Section 2) only requires `docker`, `python3`, `unzip`, and the OneDrive
bundle from Section 1.3 — the `anthropic` / `openai` PyPI packages and the
`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` / `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variables are **not**
used by replay mode.

### 4.1 Already required

- **Docker** (Docker Desktop on macOS, or `dockerd` on Linux) must be running
  and reachable; `docker info` must succeed without `sudo`.
- **Approximately 15 GB of free disk** is required for the dataset (~124 MB),
  the Docker base image and the in-image Surefire fork build (~3 GB), and the
  per-run archives (~150 MB × `N` runs × number of models).

### 4.2 Also needed on the host

The orchestrator runs on the host in Python and delegates JVM and Maven work
to the container. The host therefore requires the following tools and
credentials:

| Tool | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `python3` (≥ 3.8) with `pip` and `venv` | runs `run_pass_at_k.py` / `simulate_run_pass_at_k.py` and the LLM scripts |
| `anthropic` PyPI package | Claude backend (live mode only) |
| `openai` PyPI package | OpenAI backend (live mode only) |
| `unzip` | unzips the dataset archive (live mode) and the OneDrive bundle (replay mode) |
| `patch` | applies `Fixed.patch` |
| `curl` *(or `wget`)* | downloads the dataset archive on first use |
| `git` | clones the repository |
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` and/or `OPENAI_API_KEY` | **Live mode only.** The LLM step is mandatory in live mode; the pipeline aborts when the key for the selected backend is unset. The default `--models claude,openai` run requires both keys. Replay mode does not consult these env vars. |

All remaining build-time dependencies — the selected JDK 8/11/17 image,
Maven 3.8.6, the
TestingResearchIllinois Surefire fork (`3.0.0-M8-SNAPSHOT`), `xmlstarlet`,
`beautifulsoup4`, and `lxml` — are baked into the Docker image and require no
host-side installation.

---

## 5. Install the host tools

Python dependencies are installed into a virtual environment. System-wide
installation via `pip install --user` is not used: Python 3.12 and later
(including Homebrew Python on macOS and the system Python on Ubuntu 24.04+
and Debian 12+) enforce PEP 668 and reject such installations with
`error: externally-managed-environment`.

### 5.1 macOS

`unzip`, `patch`, `curl`, `git`, and `python3` are provided by the Xcode
Command Line Tools. If these are not present, the first command below
triggers an installation prompt:

```bash
xcode-select --install                   # one-time; installs unzip, patch, curl, git, python3
python3 --version                        # verify >= 3.8

python3 -m venv ~/.venvs/reproflake
source ~/.venvs/reproflake/bin/activate
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install anthropic openai
```

Alternatively, install Python via Homebrew:

```bash
brew install python git
python3 -m venv ~/.venvs/reproflake
source ~/.venvs/reproflake/bin/activate
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install anthropic openai
```

### 5.2 Ubuntu / Debian

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y python3 python3-pip python3-venv unzip patch curl git

python3 -m venv ~/.venvs/reproflake
source ~/.venvs/reproflake/bin/activate
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install anthropic openai
```

For other Linux distributions, install the equivalent of `python3 python3-pip
python3-venv unzip patch curl git` from the system package manager, then
create and activate the virtual environment as shown above.

> The virtual environment must be active in the current shell each time the
> orchestrator is invoked. If it is not active, the LLM scripts abort with
> `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'anthropic'` (or `'openai'`).

### 5.3 API keys

> Skip this subsection entirely if you are only doing replay mode (Section 2)
> — replay does not call any LLM API and does not read these env vars.

Set API keys in the current shell. The default live-mode command runs both
backends, so it needs both keys; a one-backend run only needs that backend's
key.

```bash
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
```

These exports apply only to the current terminal session. When the shell is
closed the keys are lost, and subsequent pipeline invocations abort with
`ERROR: ANTHROPIC_API_KEY env var not set`. To make the keys persistent,
append the same export lines to the shell's startup file so that every new
terminal inherits them.

**macOS (zsh, the default shell since Catalina):**

```bash
echo 'export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...' >> ~/.zshrc
echo 'export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...'        >> ~/.zshrc
source ~/.zshrc
```

**Linux (bash, the default shell on most distributions):**

```bash
echo 'export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...' >> ~/.bashrc
echo 'export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...'        >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```

To determine the active shell, run `echo $SHELL`: `/bin/zsh` indicates
`~/.zshrc`; `/bin/bash` indicates `~/.bashrc`. Confirm that the keys are
visible to a fresh shell by opening a new terminal and running
`echo "$ANTHROPIC_API_KEY"`; the configured value should be printed.

### 5.4 Sanity check

Verify the host environment with the following four commands:

```bash
docker info >/dev/null && echo "docker OK"
unzip -v >/dev/null && patch --version >/dev/null && curl --version >/dev/null \
  && echo "shell tools OK"

# Live mode only — replay mode does not need these
python3 -c "import anthropic, openai; print('python deps OK')"
[[ -n "$ANTHROPIC_API_KEY" ]] && [[ -n "$OPENAI_API_KEY" ]] && echo "API keys OK"
```

Each command must print its `OK` message. The last two checks (Python
imports and API keys) are required only for live mode (Section 3); replay
mode (Section 2) needs only the docker and shell-tools checks. The Python
import check requires the virtual environment to be active in the current
shell.

---

## 6. Result layout

Per-run artifacts produced by an invocation are archived under `data/`; the
cross-invocation `Complete Containers Summary.csv` is written at the
`ReproFlake-C9E6/` root. The key per-container layout is:

```
ReproFlake-C9E6/
├── Complete Containers Summary.csv               # one row per (model, run); append-only across invocations
├── Simulated Complete Containers Summary.csv               # one row per (model, run); append-only across invocations in simulated environment
└── data/
    └── FULL_RUNS_RV/                            # "FULL_RUNS_NO_RV/" when --rv-traces no is used
        └── jnrposixd9f3f84 runs/
            ├── summary.csv                       # per-run aggregate over every run on disk (machine-readable)

            │   │   │   ├── verify_after_fix.log      # Surefire output from the post-fix test run
            │   │   │   └── verify_after_fix.verdict  # PASSED, FAILED, or INCOMPLETE
            │   │   ├── Fixed/, Flaky/             # source snapshots (target/ excluded)
            │   │   ├── traces-fixed/, traces-flaky/  # RV traces
            │   │   └── .run_complete              # sentinel containing exit_code and elapsed
            │   ├── run 2/

                ├── run 2/
                └── run 3/
```

**Replay mode** (Section 2) writes output under `data/SIMULATED_RUNS_RV/`
or `data/SIMULATED_RUNS_NO_RV/` using the identical per-run structure
shown above; its cross-invocation log lives at the `ReproFlake-C9E6/` root
as `Simulated Complete Containers Summary.csv`.

Three files address the most common questions:

- **Verdict for a single run** — `verify_after_fix.verdict` (one of `PASSED`,
  `FAILED`, or `INCOMPLETE`).
- **Aggregate across runs** — `summary.csv` (one row per run, importable into
  a spreadsheet) and its human-readable companion `summary.md` (pass@k
  report with per-run diagnosis snippets and clickable artifact links).
- **Cross-container, cross-invocation log** — `Complete Containers Summary.csv`
  at the `ReproFlake-C9E6/` root. Join back to `test_config.csv` on the
  `container` column to retrieve victim FQN, polluter, and other container
  metadata.

## 7. Script file reference

Because this artifact integrates Valg with ReproFlake, we have added 27
source scripts under the two directories below. These scripts drive trace
collection, prompt construction, LLM repair, patch application, verification,
result aggregation, and replay-mode reproduction.

> All paths in this section are relative to `ReproFlake-C9E6/` — the
> directory you `cd` into in Section 1.1.

### 7.1 `LLM Scripts/`

| file | description |
|---|---|
| `LLM Scripts/apply_fix.py` | Applies the fix stored in `llm_response.json` to the container's `Flaky/` source tree. It first tries the unified diff from `OUTPUT A`, then falls back to the structured `OUTPUT B` splicer, and records compile/recompile diagnostics in `apply_report.json`. |
| `LLM Scripts/assemble_llm_context.py` | Shared helper module for all per-type prompt assemblers. It loads CSV metadata, reads files with fallback encodings, extracts Java methods/class structure, parses failure logs, and finds production code mentioned in stack traces. |
| `LLM Scripts/build_feedback.py` | Builds the `feedback_payload.txt` user turn for a second LLM attempt after a retriable failure. It formats category-specific feedback for `compile_failed`, `test_failed`, and `patch_apply_failed` using `apply_report.json` and, when needed, `verify_after_fix.log`. |
| `LLM Scripts/call_llm.py` | Backend dispatcher used by the shell orchestrators. It selects either the Claude or OpenAI caller from the `<claude\|openai>` argument and forwards optional feedback-turn arguments. When the `SIMULATE_FROM` env var is set, the dispatcher routes to `call_llm_simulate.py` instead — replay mode (Section 2). |
| `LLM Scripts/call_llm_simulate.py` | Replay-mode backend: instead of calling Claude or OpenAI, reads the canned `llm_response_turn{1,2,3,4}.json` from the archive directory pointed at by `SIMULATE_FROM` and writes them out as if a live backend produced them. Backend-agnostic — token-usage shape is preserved verbatim from the canned file. Hard-fails with a "simulation diverged" message if a needed turn file is missing in the archive. |
| `LLM Scripts/call_llm_claude.py` | Sends `llm_context.txt` to Anthropic Claude and writes the parsed response to `llm_response.json`. It also supports the feedback round by replaying `llm_conversation.json`, appending `feedback_payload.txt`, and overwriting `llm_response.json` with the corrected final response. |
| `LLM Scripts/call_llm_openai.py` | Sends `llm_context.txt` to OpenAI `gpt-4o` and writes the parsed response to `llm_response.json`. Like the Claude caller, it can resume the saved conversation for a feedback turn and accumulates token usage metadata. |
| `LLM Scripts/fetch_artifacts.py` | Implements the closed-enum artifact retrieval protocol used between LLM turns. It parses `<ARTIFACTS_REQUESTED>` blocks and returns imports, file skeletons, method bodies, and source ranges from the target project, or MOP spec definitions from Valg's spec library. |
| `LLM Scripts/generate_llm_summary.py` | Converts the raw trace comparison in `step_8_C_official.txt` into `llm_trace_summary.txt`. It decodes event IDs, summarizes flaky-only/clean-only traces, reports frequency differences, and surfaces source-location mismatches for the prompt. |
| `LLM Scripts/patch_compare.py` | Patches the copied `/tmp/compare-traces-official.py` inside the container to tolerate malformed or non-numeric location IDs. This keeps trace comparison from crashing on imperfect TraceMOP location rows. |
| `LLM Scripts/response_parser.py` | Provider-neutral parser for the required `OUTPUT 0`, `OUTPUT A`, and `OUTPUT B` response format. It extracts diagnosis text, the unified diff, root-cause/fix-description text, and structured `@@FILE`/`@@METHOD` fixed-code entries. |
| `LLM Scripts/rv/assemble_llm_context_id.py` | Builds the RV-enabled LLM prompt for ID flaky tests. It omits polluter context, uses NonDex failure output, includes RV trace analysis, and frames fixes around deterministic collection/map/set ordering. |
| `LLM Scripts/rv/assemble_llm_context_nio.py` | Builds the RV-enabled LLM prompt for NIO flaky tests. It includes the generated run-twice wrapper, explains the NIO cleanup pattern, adds RV trace analysis with an empty-trace caveat, and forbids patching the wrapper. |
| `LLM Scripts/rv/assemble_llm_context_od.py` | Builds the RV-enabled LLM prompt for OD and brittle tests. It includes both polluter and victim source context, failure output, production stack context, RV trace analysis, and a task framing around shared-state cleanup or defensive setup. |
| `LLM Scripts/rv/assemble_llm_context_td.py` | Builds the RV-enabled LLM prompt for TD flaky tests. It focuses on the victim method, failure output, related production code, RV trace analysis, and likely timing/asynchrony/determinism fixes. |
| `LLM Scripts/no_rv/assemble_llm_context_id.py` | Builds the ID ablation prompt without the RV trace-analysis section. It keeps the same NonDex and ordering-focused task framing as the RV version so the experiment isolates the effect of RV trace evidence. |
| `LLM Scripts/no_rv/assemble_llm_context_nio.py` | Builds the NIO ablation prompt without RV trace evidence or the RV empty-trace caveat. It still includes the generated wrapper and the self-pollution cleanup framing used to repair NIO tests. |
| `LLM Scripts/no_rv/assemble_llm_context_od.py` | Builds the OD/brittle ablation prompt without RV trace analysis or RV spec-definition guidance. It preserves the polluter/victim source context and shared-state task framing from the RV version. |
| `LLM Scripts/no_rv/assemble_llm_context_td.py` | Builds the TD ablation prompt without RV trace analysis or RV spec-definition guidance. It keeps the victim-focused TD prompt structure so results can be compared directly against the RV-enabled version. |

### 7.2 `TraceMop Scripts/`

| file | description |
|---|---|
| `TraceMop Scripts/compare-traces-official.py` | Compares two TraceMOP trace directories using `locations.txt`, `unique-traces.txt`, and `events_encoding_id.txt`. It reports location mismatches, traces missing from either side, and trace-frequency differences for downstream summarization. |
| `TraceMop Scripts/feedback_loop.sh` | Shared shell helper sourced by the per-type orchestrators after the first LLM fix attempt. It runs `apply_fix.py` plus per-type verification up to two times, classifies retriable failures, requests feedback from the LLM, and restores `Flaky/` from `Flaky.pristine` before reapplying. |
| `TraceMop Scripts/run_id_tracemop.sh` | End-to-end orchestrator for ID flaky tests. It runs a passing baseline and a NonDex seeded failing run under TraceMOP, compares traces, generates the LLM prompt, calls the selected backend, applies the patch, and verifies with the same NonDex seed. |
| `TraceMop Scripts/run_nio_tracemop.sh` | End-to-end orchestrator for NIO flaky tests. It generates a JUnit wrapper that runs the victim twice in one JVM, traces Fixed and Flaky wrapper executions, prompts the LLM, applies the fix, and verifies that the patched wrapper passes both invocations. |
| `TraceMop Scripts/run_od_tracemop.sh` | End-to-end orchestrator for OD flaky tests. It runs the polluter and victim in deterministic order on Fixed and Flaky variants, collects and compares TraceMOP traces, invokes the LLM repair flow, and verifies the patched Flaky variant with the same ordered test run. |
| `TraceMop Scripts/run_pass_at_k.py` | Live-mode batch wrapper (Section 3) for repeated experiments across models and runs. It selects the correct per-type orchestrator from `test_config.csv`, toggles the RV/no-RV prompt ablation, archives each run, writes per-container `summary.csv` + `summary.md` (pass-at-k report with diagnosis snippets and artifact links), and appends the top-level `Complete Containers Summary.csv`. |
| `TraceMop Scripts/simulate_run_pass_at_k.py` | Replay-mode batch wrapper (Section 2). Mirrors `run_pass_at_k.py` end-to-end but injects `SIMULATE_FROM` so the LLM step replays from the archives at `data/FULL_RUNS_<RV\|NO_RV>/`. Output goes under `data/SIMULATED_RUNS_<RV\|NO_RV>/`; cross-invocation log is `Simulated Complete Containers Summary.csv`. Pre-validates archive presence, clamps `--runs` to 2, and does not require API keys. |
| `TraceMop Scripts/run_td_tracemop.sh` | End-to-end orchestrator for TD flaky tests. It materializes Fixed and FlakyCodeChange variants, traces both, compares runtime behavior, assembles the TD prompt, calls the LLM, applies the patch, and verifies the patched victim test. |


## 8. Log of jnrposix

The jnrposix example is an OD run, so the numbered log steps are primarily
owned by [`run_od_tracemop.sh`](TraceMop%20Scripts/run_od_tracemop.sh). Section
7 gives one-file descriptions; the table below maps the visible log steps to
their purpose and the scripts involved.

| log step | purpose | script reference |
|---|---|---|
| `step 0` | Optional start-of-run cleanup that removes stale materialized source directories from a previous run while keeping logs/traces for inspection. | [`run_od_tracemop.sh`](TraceMop%20Scripts/run_od_tracemop.sh) |
| `step 1a`/`step 1b`/`step 1c` | Download and unzip the Zenodo container archive, then materialize `Fixed/` and `Flaky/` from the archive and `Fixed.patch`; `step 1c` appears only when those directories already exist. | [`run_od_tracemop.sh`](TraceMop%20Scripts/run_od_tracemop.sh) |
| `step 2` | Start the Docker container for the required Java version and mount the container data directory into it. | [`run_od_tracemop.sh`](TraceMop%20Scripts/run_od_tracemop.sh) |
| `step 3` | Copy `experiments/tracemop.jar` into the running container so the Maven run can attach TraceMOP. | [`run_od_tracemop.sh`](TraceMop%20Scripts/run_od_tracemop.sh) |
| `step 4a`/`step 4b` | Build the JavaMOP Maven extension inside the container and install `tracemop.jar` into the container's local Maven repository. | [`run_od_tracemop.sh`](TraceMop%20Scripts/run_od_tracemop.sh) |
| `step 4d` | Run the OD polluter and victim tests under TraceMOP on both `Fixed/` and `Flaky/`, producing `traces-fixed/` and `traces-flaky/`. | [`run_od_tracemop.sh`](TraceMop%20Scripts/run_od_tracemop.sh) |
| `step 5` | Prepare trace-comparison tooling in the container, including the local `compare-traces-official.py` copy and its compatibility patch. | [`run_od_tracemop.sh`](TraceMop%20Scripts/run_od_tracemop.sh), [`patch_compare.py`](LLM%20Scripts/patch_compare.py) |
| `step 6` | Compare failing-run traces against passing-run traces and write the raw diff report to `step_8_C_official.txt`. | [`compare-traces-official.py`](TraceMop%20Scripts/compare-traces-official.py) |
| `step 7` | Decode and summarize the raw trace comparison into `llm_trace_summary.txt` for the LLM prompt. | [`generate_llm_summary.py`](LLM%20Scripts/generate_llm_summary.py) |
| `step 8` | Assemble `llm_context.txt`, including OD-specific polluter/victim context and, for this RV run, the RV trace-analysis section. | [`rv/assemble_llm_context_od.py`](LLM%20Scripts/rv/assemble_llm_context_od.py) |
| `step 9` | Send the assembled prompt to the selected LLM backend and save the parsed response as `llm_response.json`. | [`call_llm.py`](LLM%20Scripts/call_llm.py), [`call_llm_claude.py`](LLM%20Scripts/call_llm_claude.py), [`response_parser.py`](LLM%20Scripts/response_parser.py) |
| `step 9.5` | Snapshot the pristine `Flaky/` tree so a feedback retry can restore it before applying a corrected patch. | [`run_od_tracemop.sh`](TraceMop%20Scripts/run_od_tracemop.sh), [`feedback_loop.sh`](TraceMop%20Scripts/feedback_loop.sh) |
| `step 10` | Apply the LLM-produced fix to `Flaky/`, then compile/recompile touched code and write `apply_report.json`. | [`feedback_loop.sh`](TraceMop%20Scripts/feedback_loop.sh), [`apply_fix.py`](LLM%20Scripts/apply_fix.py) |
| `step 11` | Re-run the OD polluter/victim order against patched `Flaky/` and write `verify_after_fix.log` plus `verify_after_fix.verdict`. | [`run_od_tracemop.sh`](TraceMop%20Scripts/run_od_tracemop.sh), [`feedback_loop.sh`](TraceMop%20Scripts/feedback_loop.sh) |
| optional feedback retry | If the first patch fails to apply, compile, or pass verification, build a feedback prompt, ask the same LLM for a corrected patch, restore `Flaky/`, and repeat steps 10-11 once. | [`feedback_loop.sh`](TraceMop%20Scripts/feedback_loop.sh), [`build_feedback.py`](LLM%20Scripts/build_feedback.py), [`call_llm.py`](LLM%20Scripts/call_llm.py) |
| final summary | Print trace directories, output file sizes, and the final post-fix verdict. If invoked through pass@k, the wrapper archives this run and updates `summary.csv` and `summary.md`. | [`run_od_tracemop.sh`](TraceMop%20Scripts/run_od_tracemop.sh), [`run_pass_at_k.py`](TraceMop%20Scripts/run_pass_at_k.py) |

`run_pass_at_k.py` sets `KEEP_CONTAINER=1` while each per-run orchestrator is
executing so the same container can be reused within the batch. Unless
`--keep-workspace` is passed to `run_pass_at_k.py`, the wrapper removes that
container and the scratch `data/<container>/` workspace after the batch has
been archived.

The complete log of jnrposix for one particular run. For each run, the whole log can be found in the respective container/model/run folder's pipeline.log file:
